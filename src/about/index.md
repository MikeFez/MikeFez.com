# About Me

## A little about me

Growing up, I was that child that would disassemble his toys rather than play with them, because the real fun was in seeing just how exactly they functioned. Plain and simple, I'm a tinkerer. Learning, conceptualizing, designing, improving and creating. These processes are are the core to my being.
