excerpt: Running Plex on Unraid and want recent recordings on an SSD/NVMe share? I created a Python script that automatically identifies watched media and moves it from my cache to my larger array, optimizing storage while preserving my library structure.
---

## The Plex Storage Balancing Act

Running a Plex server presents an interesting storage challenge. New content and current watches benefit from the speed of SSD storage, but maintaining a large library quickly becomes expensive if everything stays on fast drives.

I noticed a pattern in our household's viewing habits - once we finish watching something, we rarely return to it. Yet all this watched content was taking up valuable space on my fastest storage.

The standard Unraid mover didn't solve this problem because it doesn't know which media has been watched. I needed something smarter - a tool that could make storage decisions based on our actual viewing behavior.

## Watch Status as a Storage Signal

I created a Python script that uses the Plex API to identify watched content. It:

Connects to my Plex server and examines all libraries
Checks watch status across all users in my household
Identifies completely watched shows and movies
Moves them from my NVME cache to the array storage
Preserves the exact file structure so Plex doesn't notice the change

This approach makes much more logical use of my tiered storage. Content we're actively watching stays fast and responsive, while our "digital memories" move to more cost-effective storage. The best part is that it happens automatically based on how we actually use our media library.

## How It Works

### Connecting to Plex

The script uses the Python `plexapi` library to connect to your Plex server:

```python
def connect_to_plex():
    """
    Connect to Plex server using the global URL and token
    """
    try:
        log(f"Connecting to Plex server at {PLEX_URL}...")
        server = PlexServer(PLEX_URL, PLEX_TOKEN)
        log(f"Connected successfully to {server.friendlyName}")
        return server
    except Exception as e:
        log(f"Error connecting to Plex server: {e}")
        exit(1)
```

### Scanning All Users' Watch History

One unique aspect of this script is that it checks the watch history for all home users, not just the main account:

```python
def get_watched_media(server):
    """
    Get a list of all watched media across all home users and all libraries
    """
    # Get the main account
    log("Retrieving Plex account information...")
    main_account = server.myPlexAccount()
    log(f"Account: {main_account.username}")

    all_watched_media = []

    try:
        # Connect to the server using the admin account
        admin_server = server
        admin_username = main_account.username

        # Process admin account
        process_user_watched_media(admin_server, admin_username, all_watched_media)

        # Get all users from the account
        log("Retrieving all users...")
        users = main_account.users()

        # Process each home user...
```

This approach ensures that if any user in your household has watched a movie or episode, it gets moved to the array storage.

### Moving Files While Preserving Structure

The script translates paths between the Plex container and host system, then moves files while keeping the directory structure intact:

```python
# Calculate the destination path
rel_path = os.path.relpath(host_path, nvme_source_path)
dest_path = os.path.join(DESTINATION_PATH, rel_path)

# Use Linux 'mv' command to move the file while preserving permissions
subprocess.run(["mv", host_path, dest_path], check=True)
```

### Handling Empty Directories

After moving files, the script cleans up any empty directories:

```python
# Check and remove empty directories
delete_empty_dirs(host_path, nvme_base_dirs)
```

It's careful not to delete important base directories (like `/media/tv` or `/media/movies`), only removing truly empty subdirectories.

## Setup and Configuration

To use this script, you'll need to:

1. Install the `plexapi` Python package:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install plexapi
   ```

2. Configure the script with your specific paths:
   ```python
   # Configuration
   PLEX_URL = "http://localhost:32400"
   PLEX_TOKEN = "your_plex_token_here"

   # Volume mapping to translate between Plex container paths and host paths
   VOLUME_MAPPING = {
       "/media": "/mnt/nvme_pool/media",
       # Add other mappings as needed
   }

   # Destination path on the host system (disk array)
   DESTINATION_PATH = "/mnt/disk1/media"
   ```

3. Set up the script to run on a schedule using the Unraid User Scripts plugin

The script includes a dry run mode (`DRY_RUN = True`) that shows what would happen without actually moving any filesâ€”perfect for testing your configuration.

## Installation Notes

I ran into some Python dependency challenges when setting this up on Unraid. The system had Python installed but lacked pip. If you encounter the same issue, you can install pip with:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

Or you could create a [pex file](https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to bundle the script with its dependencies, which might be a more robust solution for Unraid's ephemeral nature.

## Results

After running this script as a scheduled task for a month, I've seen some notable benefits:

1. My NVME cache now stays below 60% utilization, focusing on the media we're currently watching
2. Watched media is automatically moved to the array without requiring manual intervention
3. Library organization remains identical, so the change is completely transparent to Plex users
4. Resource usage is minimal, with the script completing in just a few minutes
5. I get notifications when files are moved, giving me visibility into the process

The script typically moves 30-50GB of content per week on my system, keeping my tiered storage optimized automatically.

## Future Enhancements

I'm considering a few improvements for the future:

- Add a configurable "cooldown period" (e.g., keep media on fast storage for 1 week after watching)
- Create a companion script to identify and promote "recently added but unwatched" media to fast storage
- Add a simple web UI to see statistics and override decisions for specific media

For now, though, this solution has eliminated a tedious manual process and keeps my Plex server's storage optimized with zero effort on my part.
